Welcome to the source code generator for HTML writer, written in Python. There are a variety of components you can add to your page. Here are the different commands available:
<br><br>Component: Keyword to be used
<br>heading: heading
<br>subheading: subheading
<br>normal text: normaltxt
<br>horizontal line: hr
<br>image: img
<br>new line: nl
<br><br>
Enter one of these commands in the program if you want to add them. The program will then ask for the details such as the color, size(if any), etc.
<br>
You can also introduce layouts to organise your content. Here are the different layouts available:<br>
<img src = "images/HTMLwriter layouts (1).jpg" height = "595" width = "850"><br>
Use all of these components to build your webpage! We hope you enjoy!
<br><br>
(Note: Colors can be entered either as text, if it is a standard color, or as a hexadecimal code.)
<br>(Note: Kindly delete all contents of the source code file after using the program if you want to create another page.
